      <h2>passgen.pl</h2>
      <p>As a Perl developer, I created a password generator script using the Crypt::RandPasswd module. The script generates passwords of a specified length, with the option to include special characters. To ensure the script is user-friendly, I added functionality to time the execution of the script, providing valuable insights into performance. I believe this script showcases my proficiency in Perl programming and my ability to work with third-party modules to deliver efficient solutions. Overall, I am proud of the value this script brings to users who need to create strong passwords quickly and easily.</p>

      <h2>py-no-cam</h2>
      <p>Py-no-cam is a program designed to enhance privacy and security by dynamically scanning for all cameras attached to the system and disabling them. Once executed, the program scans the system for any attached cameras and kicks them off of the USB bus, effectively disabling them. This ensures that nobody unwanted is able to access or use the cameras to look through and violate the user's privacy. Py-no-cam is a powerful tool that can be used to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access to cameras, making it an excellent choice for those who value their privacy and security. By using py-no-cam, users can have peace of mind knowing that their cameras are protected from any unauthorized access.</p>
